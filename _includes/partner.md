## Working with a Partner

* For Projects 3 and 4, you may choose to work with one other student who is currently enrolled in EECS 183 Python.
* You may change partners between projects, e.g., you may have a different partner for project 3 than for project 4.
* You may not change partners during a project.
* Although you are welcome to work alone if you wish, we encourage you to consider partnering up for Project 3. If you would like a partner but don't know anyone in the class, we encourage you to use the [Search for Teammates post](https://piazza.com/class/lzh4pxb3haz135/post/5) on Piazza if you want to find someone! Please make sure to mark your search as *Done* once you've found a partner.
* As a further reminder, a partnership is defined as two people. Outside of your partnership, you are encouraged to help each other and discuss the project in English (or in some other human language), but don't share project code with anyone but your partner.
* **To register a partnership on the autograder, go to the autograder link for the project and select "Send group invitation". Then, add your partner to the group by entering their email when prompted.** They will receive a confirmation after registration, and must accept the invitation before the partnership can submit. **You must choose whether or not to register for a group on the autograder before you can submit. If you select the option to work alone, you will not be able to work with a partner later in the project.** If a partnership needs to be changed after you register, you may submit an admin request.
* The partnership will be treated as one student for the purpose of the autograder, and you **will not** receive additional submits beyond the given four submits per day.
* If you decide to work with a partner, be sure to review [the guidelines for working with a partner](https://eecs183.github.io/docs/partners.html).
* If you choose to use late days and you are working in a partnership, review [this section](https://eecs183.github.io/docs/partners.html#late-days-and-partnerships) for how late days will be charged against each partner.
