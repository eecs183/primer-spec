## Collaboration Policy and the Honor Code

All students in the class are presumed to be decent and honorable, and all students in the class are bound by the [College of Engineering Honor Code](https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/rules/). The full collaboration policy can be found in the [syllabus](https://eecs183.github.io/py183.org/resources/).

Course policies, including those on academic integrity, are in place to encourage an effective learning environment for you. We want students to learn from and with each other, and we encourage you to collaborate. We also want to encourage you to reach out and get help when you need it.

### Encouraged Collaboration Examples

You are encouraged to:

* Give or receive help in understanding course concepts covered in lecture or lab.
* Practice and study with other students to prepare for assessments or exams.
* Consult with other students to better understand project specifications.
* Discuss general design principles or ideas as they relate to projects.
* Help others understand compiler errors or how to debug parts of their code.

To clarify the last item, you are permitted to look at another student's code to help them understand what is going on with their code. **You are not allowed to tell them what to write for their code, and you are not allowed to copy their work to use in your own solution.** If you are at all unsure whether your collaboration is allowed, please contact the course staff via the admin form before you do anything. We will help you determine if what you're thinking of doing is in the spirit of collaboration for EECS 183.

### Prohibited Collaboration Examples

The following are considered Honor Code violations:

* Submitting others' work as your own.
* Copying or deriving portions of your code from others' solutions.
* Collaborating to write your code so that your solutions are identifiably similar.
* Sharing your code with others to use as a resource when writing their code.
* Receiving help from others to write your code.
* Sharing test cases with others if they are turned in as part of your solution.
* Sharing your code in any way, including making it publicly available in any form (e.g. a public GitHub repository or personal website).

### Autograder Cheating Detection

We run every submission against every other submission and determine similarities. All projects that are "too similar" are forwarded to the Engineering Honor Council. This happens to numerous students each semester. Also know that it takes months to get a resolution from the Honor Council. Discussing the project with other students will NOT be an issue. Sharing code between students, even if it’s just one function, will likely cause the cheating detector to identify both programs as "too similar". We also search the web for solutions that may be posted online and add these into the mix of those checked for similarities. Searching the web, by the way, is something that we are very good at.

Any violation of the honor policies appropriate to each piece of course work will be reported to the Honor Council, and if guilt is established, penalties may be imposed by the Honor Council and Faculty Committee on Discipline. Such penalties can include, but are not limited to, letter grade deductions or expulsion from the University.

Also note that on all cases forwarded to the Engineering Honor Council the LSA Dean of Academic Affairs is also notified. Furthermore, the LSA rule is students involved in honor violations cannot withdraw from nor drop the course.
